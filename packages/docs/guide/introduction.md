# What is PremiAnno?

PremiAnno is a UXP-based plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro that enables time-synchronized annotation directly on the timeline. It is designed for AI research projects and media analysis workflows, allowing researchers and creators to add structured metadata, tags, or comments without leaving the editing environment.

## Why PremiAnno?

By integrating annotation into Premiere Pro, PremiAnno bridges the gap between creative editing and data collection for machine learning, video understanding, and multimodal AI research.

### Use Cases

- **AI Research**: Collect labeled datasets for video understanding and machine learning models
- **Media Analysis**: Add structured metadata for content analysis and research
- **Dataset Creation**: Build annotated video datasets for training AI models
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrate annotation into your existing editing workflow

## Key Features

- **Time-based Annotation**: Attach notes, labels, or metadata to specific timestamps or clip ranges
- **Custom Tag Sets**: Define your own annotation schema (e.g., emotions, actions, scenes)
- **Timeline Integration**: Annotations follow clip movements and edits
- **Export Options**: Export annotations as JSON/CSV for downstream AI tasks

## How It Works

PremiAnno integrates directly with Adobe Premiere Pro's UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform), providing a native panel within the application. This allows you to:

1. Select clips or timeline positions
2. Add annotations with custom tags and metadata
3. View and manage annotations in real-time
4. Export your annotated data for further analysis
